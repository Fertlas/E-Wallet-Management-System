The e-Wallet Management System is designed to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their finances digitally. It offers unlimited storage slots for transactions, ensuring users can keep track of their balances, payments, transaction dates, and remaining amounts seamlessly.

The system incorporates various features to enhance user experience and provide incentives for specific transactions. For instance, users receive a 5% discount for toll charges during off-peak hours and a 10% discount for groceries payments. Additionally, users earn RM 0.50 cashback for each top-up made with a credit card, incentivizing the use of the e-Wallet for transactions.

Users have the flexibility to view their transaction history at any time, allowing them to monitor their spending habits and track their financial activities. On the administrative side, the system provides administrators with the capability to apply discounts, issue refunds, remove transactions, and access comprehensive transaction records for all users.

Overall, the e-Wallet Management System offers a user-friendly interface with features tailored to promote digital transactions, provide financial incentives, and ensure efficient management of e-Wallet activities for both users and administrators.
